                <p class = "info">My name is Tamjid Hossain. I am currently a third year student studying Computational
                    Media at Georgia Tech and am specifically pursuing a concentration in film and animation and hope to pursue a career in those fields. My favorite animated films include Grave of the Fireflies, Wolf Children and the Toy Story series. I like to spend my time watching animated series such as Naruto and Avatar: The Last Airbender and observing how certain scenes are animated. I also have experience in Java and am currently learning to use HTML and CSS.
